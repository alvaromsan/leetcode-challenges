## Problem Description

You have to place `n` people, including Alice and Bob, at `n` distinct points on a 2D plane such that there is exactly one person at every point. Alice wants to be alone with Bob, so they must be seated at two distinct points that are closest to each other.

Return the number of distinct ways to place the people such that Alice and Bob are seated at the closest points.

### Example 1:
**Input:**

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`n = 4`

**Output:**  
`6`
